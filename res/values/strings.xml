    <!-- Tutorial -->
    <string name="tutorial">Tutorial</string>
    <string name="welcome_tutorial">Welcome to the tutorial !</string>
    <string name="tutorial_0">Here you will learn how to lead your troops to the victory.\nPress the send order button to continue !</string>
    <string name="tutorial_1">Warlords is a turn-based game. Each turn, players have to give orders to their troops.\nThen, all the orders are simultaneously processed.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_2">To win the game it is simple : you have to capture your opponents\' castles.\nYou lose if at any time you do not control any !</string>
    <string name="tutorial_3">Navigate through the map by sweeping the screen; you can also zoom in/out by pinching the screen.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_4">There are 3 types of orders in Warlords : move orders and defend orders you can give to your units, and buy orders you can give to the units\' factories you own.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_5">Let\'s start giving orders ! Give a move order to your soldier\'s unit on the castle by dragging it to the farm tile.\nA green arrow will pop, reminding you the direction.\nThen press the send order button to validate your orders\' turn !</string>
    <string name="tutorial_6">Awesome ! You have conquered a farm ! Each turn, you will earn an amount of gold depending on the number of castles and farms in your kingdom.\nObviously, conquering areas is crucial to win !</string>
    <string name="tutorial_7">Just touch a unit to give it a defend order. It will give it defensive bonuses during battles.\nOne more thing about move orders, there can\'t be more than 3 units on one tile. Keep it in mind !</string>
    <string name="tutorial_8">Let\'s battle now ! Attack and conquer the fort with your troops, you will be able to hire units on it !</string>
    <string name="tutorial_9">Cool, it was a great battle. As you can see your unit has gained experience (green bar) and lose a bit of morale (blue bar).\nMorale of your troops is important : if low, they will flee the battlefield !</string>
    <string name="tutorial_10">Ok, let\'s buy units now ! Open the buy menu by touching the yellow coin on the tile. Then select the unit you want to hire; it will pop-up the next turn !</string>
    <string name="tutorial_11">As said before, each turn you are earning gold from your territories. But in Warlords, you also need to pay and supply your armies !\nWhen you are buying a new unit, the price indicated is the price you have to pay every turn. If at any time, you don\'t have enough money to supply your armies, these will lose morale and even desert !</string>
    <string name="tutorial_12">It is recommanded to keep a stable economy; you can see your current balance by opening the left-hand side drawer.\nAlso beware of the weather changes, you will earn less gold during winter !</string>
    <string name="tutorial_13">Let\'s attack the enemy castle to win the game and finish this tutorial !\nYou can get much more information on battles, terrain tiles, and armies abilities in the How to Play section !</string>
